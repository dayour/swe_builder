# Claude Code Instructions for MCS Automation

## Overview

Automate Microsoft Copilot Studio (MCS) agent creation using a **hybrid build stack**: PAC CLI for lifecycle operations, Dataverse API for configuration, Code Editor YAML for topics, Direct Line API for testing, and Playwright MCP only for operations that have no API alternative.

**CRITICAL: Never assume components. Research BROADLY first (web, MS Learn, community — not just one source), recommend based on requirements.**

---

## MANDATORY: Build Discipline — Verify-Then-Mark

**THIS IS A HARD STOP. Every build step must be verified before marking complete.**

### Rules

1. **Atomic tasks**: Every build step is a SEPARATE task in TaskCreate. "Generate CSV" + "upload to MCS" + "run eval" = THREE tasks, not one. Never combine steps that happen in different systems (local file vs MCS UI vs API).
2. **Verify after every action**: After each change, snapshot/read-back to confirm it worked:
   - Instructions updated → snapshot confirms text saved (not still in edit mode)
   - Tool added/removed → snapshot Tools tab confirms tool list matches spec
   - Trigger created/deleted → snapshot Triggers section confirms expected state
   - Published → snapshot confirms Published date is today
   - CSV generated → read file back to confirm content
   - Eval uploaded → snapshot Evaluation tab confirms test case count
3. **Never mark complete until verified**: If you can't verify, tell the user "I did X but couldn't verify Y" rather than silently assuming success.
4. **File ≠ deployment**: Writing a local file is NOT the same as uploading it to MCS. These are ALWAYS separate tasks.
5. **Environment check**: Before PAC CLI operations, verify the agent's environment matches PAC CLI's active profile (`pac auth list`). If they differ, use browser instead.
6. **End-of-build reconciliation + QA validation**: After ALL changes, walk the spec's build checklist and snapshot-verify every item against the actual agent state. Then spawn QA Challenger (Step 5.5) to validate brief-vs-actual, cross-references, and deviation impact. QA verdict determines whether the build proceeds to the report or escalates issues.

---

## MANDATORY: MCS Browser Preflight — Silent Verification

**Every browser interaction with Copilot Studio requires environment verification. But verification is silent — it only prompts the user when something is wrong.**

### Two-Tier Model

**Tier 1 — Persist Once:** Account and environment are selected once (during the first build for a new agent) and persisted to `brief.json.buildStatus` + `tools/session-config.json`. All subsequent operations read from persisted config.

**Tier 2 — Verify Silently:** Before every Playwright interaction, navigate to MCS, snapshot, and compare the browser's actual account/environment against the persisted selection. If they match, proceed immediately. If they don't, alert the user.

### Preflight Steps (every browser interaction)

1. **Read persisted config:** Check `brief.json.buildStatus.account` / `.environment`. If not available, check `tools/session-config.json` sessionDefaults.
2. `browser_navigate` to `https://copilotstudio.microsoft.com`
3. `browser_snapshot` — wait for load (if "Loading...", re-snapshot after 2-3s)
4. Extract from snapshot: **Account name** (top-right) + **Environment name** (header bar)
5. **Compare** snapshot values against persisted config:

| Result | Action |
|--------|--------|
| **Match** | Log one line: `Browser verified: {account} / {environment}` — proceed immediately |
| **Mismatch** | Alert: `Browser shows {X} but target is {Y}. Switch environment?` — WAIT for user |
| **No persisted config** | First-time flow (see below) — ask once and persist |

### First-Time Selection (no persisted config)

Only runs when BOTH `brief.json.buildStatus` and `session-config.json.sessionDefaults` lack account/environment:

1. Use `AskUserQuestion` to pick account + environment
2. Persist to `brief.json.buildStatus` AND `session-config.json.sessionDefaults`
3. Proceed with the browser action

If `sessionDefaults` exist but `buildStatus` doesn't (new agent, returning user): pre-fill from sessionDefaults and confirm with a single yes/no question.

### When to Re-Ask Explicitly

- **New project's first build** — no buildStatus exists
- **New agent's first build** — agent has no buildStatus (but sessionDefaults may pre-fill)
- **User says "switch to..."** — re-run picker and update both persistence locations

### Rules

- If the page hasn't loaded yet (shows "Loading..."), WAIT and re-snapshot
- If the user says the environment is wrong, help them switch BEFORE doing anything
- NEVER click on an agent, tab, button, or form element until verification passes
- On match, do NOT output a stamp or ask for confirmation — just log and proceed

## Hybrid Build Stack — Tool Priority

**Use the best tool for each job. Playwright is the last resort, not the default.**

### Tool Priority Order

| Priority | Tool | Use For |
|----------|------|---------|
| 1 | **PAC CLI** | Agent publishing, status checks, solution export/import, listing agents |
| 2 | **Dataverse API** | Instructions update, knowledge file upload, security settings, agent deletion |
| 3 | **Code Editor YAML** | Topic authoring, adaptive cards, branching logic, trigger phrases |
| 4 | **Direct Line API** | Evaluation / testing (send messages, compare responses) |
| 5 | **Playwright MCP** | Agent creation, model selection (always latest), tool/connector addition, OAuth connections, child agent connection, generative AI settings, MCS-only UI operations |

**Detailed capabilities per layer:** See `knowledge/cache/api-capabilities.md`
**Decision flow and build phase mapping:** See `knowledge/frameworks/tool-priority.md`

---

## Agent Teams (Experimental)

Agent Teams enables bidirectional communication between specialist teammates who challenge each other's work. The lead (you) orchestrates, teammates do the reasoning/generation, and the lead handles MCS execution (Playwright, PAC CLI, Dataverse).

**Enabled via:** `CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS=1` in `.claude/settings.json`

### Teammates

| Teammate | Role | Key Strength |
|----------|------|-------------|
| **Research Analyst** | Discover MCS capabilities across multiple sources | Prevents false limitation claims |
| **Prompt Engineer** | Write MCS agent instructions + review/sharpen our own skill files and agent definitions when quality drops | Sharp instructions, correct `/` references |
| **Topic Engineer** | Generate validated YAML topics + adaptive cards | Syntax-correct YAML, channel-safe cards |
| **QA Challenger** | Review ALL outputs, find gaps, challenge claims | Catches errors before they hit MCS |
| **Repo Checker** | Validate repo integrity after changes | Catches broken paths, stale docs, drift |
| **Flow Designer** | Design Power Automate flows for agent integrations | Flow JSON, connector patterns, trigger/action composition |
| **Repo Optimizer** | Refactor project structure, clean drift, validate cross-references | Dead code detection, repo health scoring |

Definitions: `.claude/agents/` (research-analyst.md, prompt-engineer.md, topic-engineer.md, qa-challenger.md, repo-checker.md, flow-designer.md, repo-optimizer.md)

### When to Use Agent Teams

**During MCS workflow skills:**
- **Research phase** (`/mcs-research`): Research Analyst searches for external connectors/MCP (only if needed), Prompt Engineer writes instructions (single pass), **Topic Engineer validates topic feasibility (Phase D)**, QA Challenger reviews instructions + generates eval sets (single pass each)
- **Build phase** (`/mcs-build`): Topic Engineer generates YAML, QA Challenger reviews before execution, **eval-driven iteration loop** (critical gate → per-capability → regression), **Research Analyst on-demand (connector issues)**, **Prompt Engineer on-demand (instruction adjustments + fix iteration)**
- **Eval phase** (`/mcs-eval`): Runs eval sets (all or specific), writes per-test results to evalSets
- **Fix phase** (`/mcs-fix`): QA Challenger classifies failures, Prompt Engineer fixes instructions, Topic Engineer fixes topics

**During general development (Tier 2-3 checks):**
- **Tier 2**: Repo Checker in background after 3+ file changes or code changes
- **Tier 3**: QA Challenger before irreversible decisions (schema, workflow, architecture)

### Workflow: Lead + Teammates

```
Lead spawns team for build:
  Research Analyst → discovers components (parallel)
  Prompt Engineer → writes instructions
  Topic Engineer → generates topic YAML + adaptive cards
  QA Challenger → reviews all outputs, challenges, finds gaps

  Teammates communicate directly:
    QA → Prompt Engineer: "Instructions reference /ToolName that isn't configured"
    QA → Topic Engineer: "YAML node ID duplicated on line 14"
    Topic Engineer → Prompt Engineer: "Your instructions expect Topic.orderStatus but no topic initializes it"

Lead executes validated outputs:
  - Pastes YAML into MCS code editor (Playwright)
  - Sets instructions via Dataverse API
  - Configures tools (Playwright)
  - Publishes (PAC CLI)
```

### Rules

- **Lead does NOT generate instructions, YAML, or cards directly.** Delegate to teammates.
- **Lead DOES handle all MCS execution** (Playwright, PAC CLI, Dataverse API) since MCP access in teammates is unreliable.
- **QA Challenger reviews EVERY teammate output** before the lead executes it.
- **Teammates challenge each other** — bidirectional communication is the point.
- **All generated artifacts go to files** (Build-Guides/[Project]/topics/, instructions, etc.) so the lead can read and execute them.

### Proactive Quality Checks — 3 Tiers

Quality checks scale with risk. Not every response needs a full team debate.

**Tier 1: Self-Check (always, after any edits)**
After any batch of edits, do a quick inline verification: grep for broken references, re-read changed files, verify cross-references. Takes 10-20 seconds, catches obvious issues. No teammate needed.

**Tier 2: Background Repo Check (after significant changes)**
After changing 3+ files or any code changes, spawn Repo Checker in background. It runs async — don't block, keep working. Results come back in ~60 seconds. Fix issues if found.

**Tier 3: QA Challenge (before irreversible decisions only)**
Before committing to designs that are hard to undo — schema changes, workflow redesign, architecture decisions affecting multiple files. QA Challenger reviews and challenges the approach. This blocks work but is worth the wait for big decisions.

| Trigger | Tier | Blocks Work? |
|---------|------|-------------|
| Any file edits | Tier 1: self-check (grep + re-read) | No — inline, 10 sec |
| 3+ file changes or code changes | Tier 2: Repo Checker in background | No — runs async |
| Schema change, workflow redesign, architecture decision | Tier 3: QA Challenger | Yes — worth the 2-3 min |
| Before any commit | Tier 2: Repo Checker | No — runs async |
| Simple answer, status check, brainstorming | None | — |

## Bug Reports & Suggestions

Users file bugs and suggestions via the header buttons, which open a feedback dialog. The dialog collects a description + auto-gathered context (project, agent, page, build/eval status), then dispatches `/bug` or `/suggest` to the embedded Claude terminal for ADO work item creation.

**Work item creation rules:**
- Target: ADO `powercatteam/FDE` (`az boards work-item create --org https://dev.azure.com/powercatteam --project FDE`)
- Work item types: `Bug` for bugs, `Feature` for suggestions
- Always preview title + body before submitting — never auto-submit
- Use HEREDOC for the `--description` argument to preserve formatting
- Auto-enrich with session context (project, agent, page, build status, eval score) when available
- Keep titles under 70 characters (`Bug: ...` or `Suggestion: ...`)
- When invoked with pre-filled args from the dashboard dialog, skip the "ask" step and go straight to drafting

---

## Learning System — Continuous Improvement

The system captures learnings from every build and makes them available in future research. This creates a **feedback loop**: builds generate insights → insights improve future research → better specs → better builds.

### Knowledge Layers

| Layer | Location | What | Refresh |
|-------|----------|------|---------|
| **Official cache** | `knowledge/cache/` | MCS capabilities from MS Learn + WebSearch | Auto (session start + before research) |
| **Experience learnings** | `knowledge/learnings/` | Insights from past builds, user feedback, failures | After every build/research/eval |
| **Stable patterns** | `knowledge/patterns/` | YAML syntax, Playwright patterns, Dataverse API | Manual (rarely changes) |
| **Decision frameworks** | `knowledge/frameworks/` | Component selection, architecture scoring | Manual (rarely changes) |

### Learnings Capture Points

| When | What Gets Captured | How |
|------|-------------------|-----|
| **Post-build** | Spec vs actual diff, errors & fixes, new discoveries, build method insights | Structured summary → user confirms → written to topic files |
| **Post-research** | New components found, cache corrections, customer/industry patterns | Summary if discoveries exist → user confirms |
| **Post-eval** | Failure patterns, eval method insights, scoring calibration | Summary if insights exist → user confirms |
| **Anytime** | User says "remember that X" or provides feedback | Write directly to relevant topic file |

### Learnings Topic Files (`knowledge/learnings/`)

| File | Consulted During |
|------|-----------------|
| `connectors.md` | `/mcs-research` Phase B (component research) |
| `integrations.md` | `/mcs-research` Phase B (system integration choices) |
| `architecture.md` | `/mcs-research` Phase C (architecture scoring) |
| `instructions.md` | `/mcs-research` Phase C (Prompt Engineer) |
| `topics-triggers.md` | `/mcs-research` Phase D + `/mcs-build` Step 4 |
| `eval-testing.md` | `/mcs-research` Phase D + `/mcs-eval` |
| `build-methods.md` | `/mcs-build` (tool selection per step) |
| `customer-patterns.md` | `/mcs-research` Phase B (component research) |

> **Complete consultation matrix:** See "Learnings Protocol" § D below for all consultation points across all skills.

### How Learnings Are Used

During research, learnings are presented as **additional options, not defaults**:

> "Official docs recommend Connector X. However, in a past build for [customer], we found Y works better because [reason] (confirmed in 3 builds). Consider both options."

Higher `Confirmed` count = higher weight, but the user always decides.

### Confidence Levels

| Confirmed In | Weight | Presentation |
|-------------|--------|-------------|
| 1 build | Low | "In one past build, we observed..." |
| 2-3 builds | Medium | "Based on multiple builds, we recommend considering..." |
| 4+ builds | High | "Consistently confirmed: ..." |

### Learnings Protocol — Automated Capture & Consultation

Learnings are captured automatically after every phase and consulted throughout every skill — not just research. A machine-readable `knowledge/learnings/index.json` enables deduplication, confirmed-count tracking, and staleness detection.

#### A. Two-Tier Capture Model

Every post-phase hook classifies learnings into one of two tiers:

| Tier | When | User Confirmation | Examples |
|------|------|-------------------|----------|
| **Tier 1 (Auto)** | Routine confirmations, cache corrections | No — silent bump/write | Same approach worked again → bump Confirmed count; cache file had wrong info → correct and log |
| **Tier 2 (User confirms)** | New discoveries, contradictions, architecture insights | Yes — present summary and wait | New failure pattern; learning contradicts existing entry; non-obvious architecture recommendation |

**Tier 1 actions:** Bump `confirmed` count and `lastConfirmed` date in `index.json`, update the entry's `Last confirmed` line in the `.md` file. No user interaction needed.

**Tier 2 actions:** Present the learning to the user with proposed file + tags. If confirmed, write entry to `.md` file and add to `index.json`.

#### B. Comparison Engine (4-step decision protocol)

Before writing any learning, run this comparison:

1. **Read `index.json`** entries with overlapping tags (match 2+ tags with the proposed learning)
2. **For each match, decide:**
   - Same scenario, same conclusion → **BUMP** confirmed count (Tier 1)
   - Same scenario, different conclusion → **FLAG** contradiction for user (Tier 2)
   - Different scenario, related tags → **ADD** as new entry (Tier 2)
   - No matches → **ADD** as new entry (Tier 2)
3. **Check related cache files:** Does the learning reveal info missing from `knowledge/cache/`? → update cache + add learning. Does it contradict cache? → **FLAG** for user.
4. **Execute decision:** BUMP / ADD / SKIP / FLAG — then update `index.json` accordingly.

#### C. Staleness Rules

| Condition | Status | Action |
|-----------|--------|--------|
| Not confirmed in > 6 months | `stale` | Flag during session startup |
| Contradicted by 2+ builds | `deprecated` | Flag and recommend removal |
| References removed component | `superseded` | Flag and recommend update |

Report during session startup alongside cache freshness:
```
Learnings: N active, M stale, K deprecated
```

#### D. Consultation Points (All Skills)

Learnings are consulted at these specific points across all workflow skills:

| Skill | Phase/Step | Learnings Files Read |
|-------|-----------|---------------------|
| `/mcs-research` | Phase B (component research) | `connectors.md`, `integrations.md`, `customer-patterns.md` |
| `/mcs-research` | Phase C (architecture + instructions) | `architecture.md`, `instructions.md` |
| `/mcs-research` | Phase D (eval sets + topics) | `topics-triggers.md`, `eval-testing.md` |
| `/mcs-build` | Before Step 1 (agent creation) | `build-methods.md` |
| `/mcs-build` | Before Step 3 (tools config) | `connectors.md`, `integrations.md` |
| `/mcs-build` | Before Step 4 (topics) | `topics-triggers.md` |
| `/mcs-eval` | Before Step 2 (run evaluation) | `eval-testing.md` |
| `/mcs-fix` | Step 2 (classify failures) | `eval-testing.md`, `instructions.md`, `topics-triggers.md` |

---

## Core Philosophy

### 1. Brief-Driven Build
The **brief.json** is the single source of truth. Everything flows from it:
- SDR/intake → **brief.json** → Build → Eval
- The brief contains everything needed to execute a build (instructions, tools, model, topics, MVP scope)
- If the brief has gaps, fill them BEFORE building (research catches gaps early)
- The dashboard reads/writes brief.json. The build skill reads it. Reports are generated from it.

### 2. Eval-Verified Quality
Evals are generated from the spec and verify the build works:
- **Golden examples** = quality bar (semantic matching, 70%+ pass)
- **Boundaries** = hard rules (must pass 100%)
- Test during build, not just at end

### 3. Multi-Agent First
Decompose into specialists by default. Score objectively (6 factors, 3+ = multi-agent).

**Always ask:** "What specialist domains does this problem require?"

### 4. Never Assume — Research Broadly
Research EVERY TIME before recommending components. Do NOT rely on a static list — MCS ships features continuously, including preview/experimental capabilities not yet in official docs. Present options with confidence, recommend the best one, let user override.

**Research sources (use ALL, not just one):**
- **WebSearch** — latest announcements, blog posts, preview features, community discoveries
- **MS Learn MCP** — official docs, reference, code samples
- **Community** — repos, discussions, sample projects, MVP blogs
- **MCS UI itself** — snapshot the actual UI to see what's available now (tools, models, knowledge types, settings)
- **Community** — Power Platform community, MVP blogs, X/Twitter from product teams

**When to research:** Every Phase 1 component selection. Every time you encounter a capability you haven't verified recently. Every error you can't explain.

### 5. Minimize Playwright — Use APIs First
Every browser interaction is fragile. Before using Playwright, check if PAC CLI, Dataverse API, Code Editor YAML, or Direct Line API can handle the operation. See "Hybrid Build Stack" section above.

---

## Intake Paths

Requirements come in one of three ways. Handle each:

### Path A: SDR Files in Project Folder
Customer provides Solution Discovery Report (SDR) documents (`.docx`, `.md`, `.pdf`).

1. Check `Build-Guides/[ProjectName]/` for SDR files
2. Convert `.docx` files to `.md` using pandoc if needed
3. **(Optional) Run `/mcs-context [CustomerName]`** → pull M365 history via WorkIQ
4. Run **Research** (`/mcs-research`) → reads docs, identifies agents, researches components, enriches brief.json + generates evals

### Path B: Pasted in Chat
User pastes requirements, SDR content, or use case description directly in conversation.

1. Create project folder: `Build-Guides/[ProjectName]/`
2. Save raw input as `sdr-raw.md` in `docs/` for reference
3. **(Optional) Run `/mcs-context [CustomerName]`** → pull M365 history via WorkIQ
4. Run **Research** (`/mcs-research`) → reads docs, identifies agents, full enrichment

### Path C: No Input — Ask User
No SDR or requirements available.

1. Ask: "What are we building? Describe the agent's purpose, users, and key scenarios."
2. **(Recommended) Run `/mcs-context [CustomerName]`** → pull M365 history via WorkIQ
3. Create project folder and save user input as `sdr-raw.md`
4. Run **Research** → **Build** → **Evaluate**

---

## Workflow

```
CREATE → UPLOAD → RESEARCH → BUILD → EVALUATE → [FIX]
                  /mcs-research  /mcs-build  /mcs-eval  /mcs-fix
```

| Step | Skill | Input | Output | Agent Teams |
|------|-------|-------|--------|-------------|
| **Init** | `/mcs-init` | Project name | Folder structure | None |
| **Context** | `/mcs-context` | Customer name | customer-context.md | None |
| **Research** | `/mcs-research {projectId}` or `/mcs-research {projectId} {agentId}` | docs/ | brief.json (fully enriched with evalSets) | RA (if needed) + PE + QA + TE |
| **Build** | `/mcs-build {projectId} {agentId}` | brief.json | MCS agent (published) + build-report.md | TE + QA (+ RA/PE on-demand) |
| **Evaluate** | `/mcs-eval {projectId} {agentId}` | brief.json evalSets | evalSets[].tests[].lastResult | QA |
| **Fix** | `/mcs-fix {projectId} {agentId}` | brief.json evalSets (failing tests) | brief.json (fixed) + re-eval results | PE + TE + QA |
| **Deploy** | `/mcs-deploy {projectId} {agentId}` | brief.json (published agent) | deployment-report.md | None |
| **Report** | `/mcs-report {projectId} {agentId} --type [brief\|build\|customer]` | brief.json | {type}-report.md | GPT review (optional) |

> **`/mcs-context`** is optional but recommended — it pulls all M365 history for a customer via WorkIQ MCP and pre-fills 60-80% of research.

---

## INIT: Initialize Project (`/mcs-init`)

Create project folder, detect SDR files, convert `.docx` → `.md`, guide user to next step.

---

## CONTEXT: Pull Customer History (`/mcs-context`)

Use WorkIQ MCP to search all M365 data (emails, meetings, documents, Teams, people) for a customer name. Compiles findings into:

- **`customer-context.md`** — Narrative summary: stakeholders, history, requirements, decisions, pain points, documents, gaps
- **`customer-interactions.csv`** — Structured timeline: date, type, participants, summary, source

**Prerequisites:** WorkIQ CLI authenticated (`workiq ask -q "test"` in terminal for first-time setup).

---

## RESEARCH: Read Docs + Full Enrichment (`/mcs-research`)

**Goal:** Read all project documents, identify agents, research MCS components, and produce fully enriched brief.json (the single source of truth) with evalSets (5 default sets: critical, functional, integration, conversational, regression).

**Input:** `/mcs-research {projectId}` (project-level) or `/mcs-research {projectId} {agentId}` (agent-level)
**Reads:** `Build-Guides/{projectId}/docs/` + `customer-context.md` (if exists) + `knowledge/cache/` + `knowledge/learnings/`
**Writes:** `brief.json` (all fields including instructions + evalSets) + `evals.csv` (derived flat export for MCS native eval compatibility)

**Smart at both levels:** Phase 0 runs for ALL invocations — detects new/changed docs, brief edits, and manually created agents. Routes to full, incremental, re-enrich, or full-agent processing as appropriate.

**4 phases (optimized — targeted research, single-pass QA):**
1. **Document comprehension & agent identification** — lead reads all docs, cross-references, identifies agents, extracts data, generates informed open questions using MCS cache
2. **Component research (targeted)** — lead resolves stable categories from cache (channels, triggers, knowledge). Research Analyst spawned ONLY for external systems needing live MCP/connector lookup
3. **Architecture + instructions (single-pass)** — lead scores architecture, Prompt Engineer writes instructions (self-verified), QA Challenger reviews once (no iteration loop)
4. **Eval sets + topic classification** — QA Challenger populates 5 eval sets (critical, functional, integration, conversational, regression), **Topic Engineer validates feasibility**, classifies topic types

**Uses Agent Teams:** Research Analyst (only if external systems need lookup), Prompt Engineer (instructions), QA Challenger (review + eval set generation), Topic Engineer (feasibility validation in Phase D).

**Iteration:** Customer reviews brief in the dashboard, answers open questions, then user re-runs `/mcs-research {projectId} {agentId}` to re-enrich (Phase 0 detects brief edits automatically).

---

## BUILD: Construct Agent (`/mcs-build`)

**Goal:** Build and publish agent(s) in Copilot Studio using the hybrid stack.

**Input:** `/mcs-build {projectId} {agentId}`
**Reads:** `brief.json` (the single source of truth — architecture, instructions, tools, model, everything)
**Writes:** `brief.json` buildStatus field (including step-level checkpoints for resume)

**Smart Account & Environment Gate:**
- Reads target from `brief.json.buildStatus.account` / `.environment` / `.accountId`
- If present → one-line confirmation ("Resuming build on {account} / {environment}"), no question asked
- If missing (first build) → reads `session-config.json`, checks `sessionDefaults` for cross-project fallback, asks user only if no prior context exists
- After selection, persists to BOTH `brief.json.buildStatus` AND `session-config.json.sessionDefaults`
- User can always override by saying "switch to [account/env]"

**Find-or-Create Agent (Step 1):**
- Reads `brief.json.buildStatus.mcsAgentId` — if set, verifies agent still exists via `pac copilot list`
- If no ID, checks `pac copilot list` for matching `displayName` before creating a new one
- Prevents duplicate agents on build restart / session crash

**Step-Level Checkpoints (Resume Logic):**
- `buildStatus.completedSteps` tracks which steps succeeded: `created`, `instructions`, `knowledge`, `tools`, `model`, `topics`, `critical-gate`, `capability-iteration`, `regression`, `published`
- On resume, completed steps are skipped — build continues from the failure point
- Publish always re-runs since it's cheap and ensures latest state

**Eval-Driven Iteration (Step 4.5 — after initial setup):**
- **Critical gate** → must pass 100% before any capability work (max 3 attempts, then HARD STOP)
- **Per-capability iteration** → run capability tests, fix failures, re-run (max 3 iterations per capability)
- **Regression suite** → cross-capability end-to-end (max 2 rounds)
- Fix logic (PE for instructions, TE for topics) runs INSIDE the build loop — no separate `/mcs-fix` needed for initial build
- Iteration limits from `evalConfig` (targetPassRate, maxIterationsPerCapability, maxRegressionRounds)

**MVP Phase Filtering:**
- Only builds items tagged `phase: "mvp"` — skips `phase: "future"` across capabilities, integrations, knowledge, and topics
- Outputs a scope summary (N MVP / M deferred) before starting
- Deferred items are listed in the build report for customer visibility

**Routes by architecture:**
- `Single Agent` → standalone build (PAC CLI + Dataverse + Playwright + YAML)
- `Multi-Agent` → specialists first, then orchestrator with child connections

**On-demand teammates:** Research Analyst (when tool configuration hits issues) and Prompt Engineer (when instructions need adjustment for actual tool names)

**QA Build Validation Gate (Step 5.5):** After publish, QA Challenger validates brief-vs-actual (every MVP item), cross-references (instructions→tools, topics→variables, routing→children), and deviation impact (severity + can-ship assessment). QA verdict (PASS / PASS WITH CAVEATS / FAIL) determines whether the build report is generated or critical issues are escalated to the user. Output: `qa-validation.md` in the agent folder.

**Silent browser verification** before any Playwright interaction (compares browser account/env against persisted buildStatus — proceeds on match, alerts on mismatch).

## EVAL: Test & Validate (`/mcs-eval`)

**Goal:** Run eval sets (all or specific) and write per-test results to brief.json for dashboard display.

**Input:** `/mcs-eval {projectId} {agentId}` or `/mcs-eval {projectId} {agentId} --set critical,functional`
**Reads:** `brief.json` evalSets array
**Writes:** `brief.json` evalSets[].tests[].lastResult + `evals-results.json`

**Three-tier eval strategy:**
- **Tier 1: Direct Line API** (preferred) — hardened with auto-token via Token Endpoint, retry with backoff, 60s timeout, structured partial results
- **Tier 2: Playwright Test Chat** (fallback) — drives Test Chat pane in MCS UI, no token needed, scores locally using same logic as Tier 1
- **Tier 3: Native MCS Eval** (async, optional) — uploads CSV to Evaluation tab, starts eval, returns immediately. Check results later with `--check-results`
- **Automatic failover:** Tier 1 → Tier 2. Tier 3 only on explicit user request (`--native` flag).

**Per-set pass logic:** each test must pass ALL methods defined by its set. Scored methods check threshold, binary methods are pass/fail.

**Test method types:** See `knowledge/cache/eval-methods.md`

### Failure Analysis

| Type | Fix |
|------|-----|
| Knowledge Gap | Update knowledge sources |
| Retrieval Failure | Improve search terms in instructions |
| Grounding Violation | Strengthen boundaries in instructions |
| Routing Failure | Expand trigger phrases, clarify routing rules |

---

## FIX: Post-Deployment Fix & Re-Evaluate (`/mcs-fix`)

**Goal:** Fix post-deployment issues — edge cases found by real users, regressions, new requirements. For initial build iteration, use `/mcs-build` (which has an internal eval-driven fix loop).

**Input:** `/mcs-fix {projectId} {agentId}`
**Reads:** `brief.json` (evalSets with failing tests, instructions, integrations, capabilities, conversations.topics)
**Writes:** `brief.json` (instructions, conversations.topics, evalSets, notes.fixHistory), agent in MCS (via hybrid stack)

**5 root cause categories:** instruction gap, boundary violation, routing failure, knowledge gap (manual — can't auto-fix), scoring issue

**Flow:** Read eval set results → QA classifies failures → User approves classification → PE fixes instructions + TE fixes topics (parallel) → Lead applies via hybrid stack → Re-evaluate via Direct Line → Compare per-set pass rates before/after

**Uses Agent Teams:** QA Challenger (failure classification), Prompt Engineer (instruction fixes), Topic Engineer (topic/trigger fixes). Max 2 fix iterations per invocation. Can add new tests to eval sets based on real-world failures.

## Component Selection & Architecture Decisions

**Component selection framework:** See `knowledge/frameworks/component-selection.md`
**Architecture scoring (single vs multi-agent):** See `knowledge/frameworks/architecture-scoring.md`
**Current inventories:** See `knowledge/cache/` (MCP servers, connectors, models, triggers, etc.)

**CRITICAL:** Always check cache freshness before using. If > 7 days old, run `/mcs-refresh` or do live research before deciding.

---

## Patterns & References

**MCS Authoring Schema:** `reference/schema/bot.schema.yaml-authoring.json` (200KB+, 433 kind values / 357 concrete types) — query via `tools/om-cli/om-cli.exe` (primary, 357 types) or `python tools/schema-lookup.py` (legacy fallback, 433 kinds)
**Code Editor YAML reference:** See `knowledge/patterns/yaml-reference.md` (action types, entity catalog, binding rules, compile errors)
**Topic YAML templates:** See `knowledge/patterns/topic-patterns/` (10 patterns including AI Builder model)
**Playwright UI patterns:** See `knowledge/patterns/playwright-patterns.md`
**Dataverse API patterns:** See `knowledge/patterns/dataverse-patterns.md`
**Trigger types:** See `knowledge/cache/triggers.md`

---

## Error Handling

**STOP → RESEARCH BROADLY → RETRY**

```
1. Don't retry same approach
2. Research across ALL sources:
   - WebSearch for the error message + "Copilot Studio"
   - MS Learn MCP for official troubleshooting
   - Community forums for known bugs / workarounds
   - MCS UI snapshot to verify current state
3. Log significant findings to knowledge/learnings/
4. Retry with researched approach
```

---

## Key Principles

1. **Brief is the blueprint** — brief.json drives the build (single source of truth)
2. **Evals drive the build** — eval sets generated from spec, critical gate before capability work, per-capability iteration during build, regression suite validates end-to-end
3. **Multi-agent first** — decompose into specialists (score objectively)
4. **Never assume** — research broadly (web + docs + UI + community), present options
5. **MVP first** — build what's possible now, plan what's blocked
6. **Build specialists first** — children before orchestrator
7. **Verify environment** — every browser session (silent verification — proceeds on match, alerts on mismatch)
8. **Research errors** — don't blindly retry
9. **Capture learnings** — every build makes next build smarter
10. **Fill gaps before building** — incomplete brief → incomplete agent
11. **Minimize Playwright** — use PAC CLI, Dataverse API, Code Editor YAML, Direct Line first
12. **MCP over connectors** — prefer MCP servers over individual connector actions
13. **Research broadly** — use WebSearch, MS Learn, community sources, and MCS UI snapshots
14. **API first, browser last** — every Playwright interaction is a fragility risk; prefer API alternatives

## Knowledge System

Cached inventories, stable patterns, and decision frameworks live in `knowledge/`:

- **`knowledge/cache/`** — 18 quick-reference cheat sheets covering MCS capabilities: options, limits, gotchas, and decision tables. For step-by-step details, use MS Learn MCP. Each file has freshness metadata. Check before architecture decisions.
- **`knowledge/patterns/`** — Stable HOW-TO references (YAML syntax, Playwright patterns, Dataverse API patterns, topic templates).
- **`knowledge/frameworks/`** — Decision frameworks (component selection, architecture scoring, tool priority).

**Tiered refresh:**
- **Tier 1 (build-critical):** triggers, models, mcp-servers, connectors, knowledge-sources, channels — auto-refreshed at session start if > 7 days old
- **Tier 2 (build-phase):** api-capabilities, instructions-authoring, generative-orchestration, adaptive-cards, ai-tools-computer-use, power-automate-integration — refreshed before `/mcs-build` if stale
- **Tier 3 (reference):** eval-methods, security-auth, agent-lifecycle, limits-licensing, powerfx-variables, conversation-design — refreshed on demand via `/mcs-refresh`

**Freshness rules:**
- < 7 days old → use as-is
- 7-30 days old → Tier 1: auto-refresh. Tier 2-3: flag, refresh on demand
- > 30 days old → refresh immediately regardless of tier

**After live research, always UPDATE the cache file** with findings + new `last_verified` date.

See `knowledge/README.md` for full details.
